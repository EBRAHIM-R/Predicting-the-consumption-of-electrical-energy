# Predicting-the-consumption-of-electrical-energy
This project helps specialists in the field of electric power production to predict the electrical load of the generation station in the near future, depending on population growth and current electrical consumption, and this helps them to develop the necessary plans in the future.

## files:
### data preprocessing.ipynb:
this file contains The processes of cleaning and modifying data and adding appropriate features to it based on the opinions of specialists in the field of electric      energy. <b> run this file first </b>
### The rest of the files are machine learning models that I created and trained on the dataset and each had a different accuracy.

##### note:
This project helps you learn to analyze data and build regression models.
